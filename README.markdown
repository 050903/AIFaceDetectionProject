A Python application leveraging OpenCV and Dlib for real-time monitoring of a user's eyes and mouth to detect signs of drowsiness, such as prolonged eye closure or frequent yawning. The system issues visual (including screen flashes) and audible alerts, making it ideal for applications like driver or machine operator fatigue monitoring.

## üìã Prerequisites

Ensure the following requirements are met before starting:

1. **Python:** Version 3.7 or higher ([download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).
2. **PIP:** Python's package installer (included with Python).
3. **Webcam:** A working webcam for video input.
4. **Dlib's Pre-trained Model:** Download `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` from the [official Dlib website](http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2).
   - Extract the `.bz2` file to obtain the `.dat` file. Place it in the project root or specify its path.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repository (replace `USERNAME/REPO_NAME`):**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
   cd REPO_NAME
   ```

2. **Install required Python libraries:**
   It's recommended to use a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   Then install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python dlib numpy scipy
   ```

   **Note:** Installing Dlib might require CMake and a C++ compiler.
   - On Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake`
   - On Windows: You may need Visual Studio with C++ build tools. Often, installing cmake via pip first helps: `pip install cmake`, then `pip install dlib`.

3. **Place the Dlib model file:**
   Ensure `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` is in the project's root directory or provide its path via the `--shape-predictor` argument.

## üöÄ Usage

Run the main Python script from your terminal:
```bash
python your_script_name.py [OPTIONS]
```
(Replace `your_script_name.py` with the actual name of your Python file).

### Command-line Arguments

<!-- MODIFIED SECTION -->
| Argument | Default Value | Description |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `--shape-predictor` | `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` | Path to Dlib's facial landmark predictor file. |
| `--ear-threshold` | `0.23` | EAR threshold for detecting closed eyes. |
| `--ear-frames` | `25` | Consecutive frames below EAR threshold for drowsiness alert. |
| `--yawn-threshold` | `0.6` | Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR) threshold for detecting a yawn. |
| `--camera` | `0` | Camera index (0 for primary webcam). |
| `--show-landmarks` | `False` | Display all 68 facial landmarks. |
| `--alarm` | `False` | Start with runtime sound/event flash alarm ON. (Toggled with 'a' key). |
| `--log` | `drowsiness_log.txt` | Path to log file (empty string '' disables logging). |
| `--face-tracking` | `True` | Enable face re-detection if temporarily lost. |
| `--perclos-window` | `60.0` | PERCLOS observation window in seconds. |

### Examples

Run with default settings (runtime alarm starts OFF unless `--alarm` is used):
```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

Start with runtime alarm ON, show landmarks, and use a custom log file:
```bash
python your_script_name.py --alarm --show-landmarks --log my_events.log
```

Use a secondary camera and a custom EAR threshold:
```bash
python your_script_name.py --camera 1 --ear-threshold 0.22
```

### Runtime Controls

<!-- MODIFIED SECTION -->
While the video window is active, use these keys:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `ESC` | Exit the program. |
| `r` | Reset counters (eye blinks, yawns, PERCLOS) and alert states. |
| `+` | Increase EAR threshold by 0.01. |
| `-` | Decrease EAR threshold by 0.01 (min 0.01). |
| `f` | Toggle fullscreen mode. |
| `a` | Toggle runtime sound/event flash alarm ON/OFF. |

## üî¨ How It Works

1. **Initialization**: Loads the facial landmark model, initializes the webcam, and sets parameters including the initial state of the runtime alarm.
2. **Frame Acquisition & Preprocessing**: Captures frames, converts to grayscale, and resizes.
3. **Face Detection & Landmark Prediction**: Uses Dlib to find faces and predict 68 landmarks.
4. **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)**:
   - Calculated for both eyes. Formula: EAR = (|P2-P6| + |P3-P5|) / (2 * |P1-P4|).
   - If average EAR < ear_threshold, increments eye_blink_counter.
   - If eye_blink_counter ‚â• ear_consec_frames, drowsiness_alert_visual_active is set to True.
5. **Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR)**:
   - Calculated as MAR = Mouth_Height / Mouth_Width.
   - If MAR > yawn_threshold, a yawn event is registered, yawn_counter increments, and yawn_alert_visual_active is set True.
6. **PERCLOS (Percentage of Eye Closure)**:
   - Tracks eye closure status (based on EAR) over a defined time window (perclos_window_seconds).
   - Calculates PERCLOS = (time_eyes_closed_in_window / total_time_window) * 100%.
7. **Display**: Renders face bounding box, eye/mouth contours (optional: all landmarks), EAR, MAR, PERCLOS, time, session duration, yawn count, and alert status.
8. **Alerting**:
   - Visual Drowsiness Alert: Displays "DROWSINESS ALERT!" text and activates screen flashing (red).
   - Visual Yawn Alert: Displays "YAWN DETECTED!" text. If runtime_alarm_active is ON, also activates screen flashing (orange-ish).
   - Audible Alert: If runtime_alarm_active (toggled by 'a' key) is ON:
     - Plays a sound once per drowsiness episode.
     - Plays a sound once per yawn episode.
   - Terminal messages are printed for each detected drowsiness or yawn event, indicating if the runtime alarm was active.
9. **Logging**: Records session start, parameter values, yawn events, and drowsiness alerts with timestamps (if a log file path is provided).

## üìù Logging

<!-- MODIFIED SECTION -->
When `--log <filename.txt>` is provided (default is `drowsiness_log.txt`), the script logs:

- Session start time, initial parameters, and initial runtime alarm state.
- Yawn events: `Yawn detected (Total: X, MAR: Y.YY)`
- Drowsiness alerts:
  - `ALERT: Drowsiness detected (EAR). Runtime alarm ON.` (if runtime alarm was ON)
  - `INFO: Drowsiness detected (EAR). Runtime alarm OFF.` (if runtime alarm was OFF)
- Yawn alerts when runtime alarm is active: `ALERT: Yawn detected. Runtime alarm ON.`
- Runtime alarm toggle events: `Runtime Sound/Event Flash Alarm Toggled: ON/OFF`

Example Log:
```
==================================================
Session started: 2024-05-11 10:00:00.123456
EAR Thresh: 0.23, EAR Frames: 25, Yawn Thresh: 0.6, PERCLOS Win: 60.0s

## üí° Potential Future Enhancements

- Cross-platform audio alerts (e.g., using playsound or simpleaudio).
- Head pose estimation to detect nodding (a common drowsiness sign).
- More robust detection in challenging conditions (low light, glasses, partial face views).
- A graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter, PyQt, Kivy, or a web framework.
- Ability to save and load user-specific configuration profiles.
- Analysis of blink rate and duration as additional drowsiness indicators.
- Integration with other systems (e.g., sending alerts to a central monitoring system).
